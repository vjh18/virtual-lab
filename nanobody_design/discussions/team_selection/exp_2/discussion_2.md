This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to use machine learning to develop antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that also, ideally, have activity against other circulating minor variants and past variants. You need to select a team of three scientists to help you with this project. Please select the team members that you would like to invite to a discussion to create the antibody/nanobody design approach. Please list the team members in the following format, using the team member below as an example. You should not include yourself (Principal Investigator) in the list.

Agent(
    title="Principal Investigator",
    expertise="applying artificial intelligence to biomedical research",
    goal="perform research in your area of expertise that maximizes the scientific impact of the work",
    role="lead a team of experts to solve an important problem in artificial intelligence for biomedicine, make key decisions about the project direction based on team member input, and manage the project timeline and resources",
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.

## Principal Investigator

To address the development of antibodies or nanobodies for the newest variant of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and potentially other variants, I will select a team with complementary expertise in AI, structural biology, and immunology. Here are the proposed team members:

Agent(
    title="Computational Biologist",
    expertise="machine learning and protein structure prediction",
    goal="apply AI techniques to predict structures and interactions of antibodies/nanobodies with viral proteins",
    role="develop and refine computational models for predicting antibody binding efficiency and specificity"
)

Agent(
    title="Structural Biologist",
    expertise="X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy",
    goal="provide structural insights into the spike protein and antibody/nanobody interactions",
    role="validate computational predictions with experimental data and advise on structural considerations for design"
)

Agent(
    title="Immunologist",
    expertise="antibody development and viral immunology",
    goal="guide the selection and design of antibodies/nanobodies with broad neutralizing potential",
    role="advise on immune response considerations and assist in evaluating the efficacy of designed antibodies in vitro and in vivo"
)

These team members will be essential for combining computational predictions with experimental validation to develop effective antibodies or nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants.
